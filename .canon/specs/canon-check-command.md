# `canon check` Command

Evaluator agent sessions do not have read access to `LOGS_DIR`.

`canon check` writes human-readable output to stdout.

This section specifies the stdout and stderr format for check runs that process
expectations. It is not an exhaustive output contract for modes that do not
process expectations.

For each passing expectation that is written to stdout, stdout contains exactly
one line:

```
P. OK
```

For each failed expectation, stdout contains exactly six lines:

```
P. FAILED
<escaped question>
Expected: <escaped expected>
Observed: <escaped observed>
Evidence: <escaped evidence>
Scope: <compact JSON array>
```

For each errored expectation, stdout contains exactly five lines:

```
P. ERROR
<escaped question>
Expected: <escaped expected>
Observed: <escaped observed>
Evidence: <escaped evidence>
```

`P` is the shortest prefix of the expectation's 20-character `ID` that uniquely
identifies that expectation among all the expectations.

Embedded control characters in question, expected answer, observed answer, and
evidence are escaped before writing to stdout. Newline is rendered as `\n`.
Escaping prevents evaluator-provided text from injecting additional stdout
lines.

`Scope` is rendered as a compact JSON array on one line.

Skipped expectations emit no per-expectation stdout. Failing results are never
skipped.

## Token Usage Line

Then stderr contains exactly one token usage line:

```
Token usage: total=<n> input=<n> (+ <n> cached) output=<n> (reasoning <n>)
```

If token usage data is unavailable, every numeric field is `0`.

## Summary Line

Then stdout contains one summary line:

```
============================= <outcome-list> in <duration>s =============================
```

`outcome-list` is a comma-separated list of non-zero outcome counts in this
order: failed, error/errors, passed, skipped. If every count is zero, the
outcome list is `0 passed`. The outcome text is surrounded by spaces and padded
with `=` characters on both sides.

Outcome labels follow pytest pluralization: `failed`, `passed`, and `skipped`
are used for both singular and plural counts; `error` is used for one error and
`errors` for every other error count.

`passed` is the number of non-skipped selected expectations whose final result
is `pass`.
`failed` is the number of selected expectations whose final result is `fail`
because the evaluator returned an answer that was parsed successfully and did
not match the expected answer.
`errors` is the number of selected expectations whose final result requires
human review.
`skipped` is the number of non-selected expectations.

## Message to Agent

Then stdout contains exactly one message line for the agent that ran
`canon check`.

If all expectations are OK:

```
✓ All checks passed. Commit is allowed.
```

If some expectations are not OK, but `canon gate` would allow the commit and at least
one expectation changed from non-OK to OK compared to HEAD:
```
▷ +<n> passes compared to HEAD. Commit the staged changes and continue fixing the remaining issues!
```
or `+1 pass` if `n` is `1`.

Otherwise (there are non-OK expectations and no progress compared to HEAD):

```
▷ Fix the issues and commit!
```
